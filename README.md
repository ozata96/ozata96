<br />Hello! My name is Omar and I'm a recent graduate from Imperial College London with a Masters in Computer Science. 
<br />
<br />
<br />My dissertation at Imperial was a multiplayer virtual reality program developed for youth that targets their social and emotional development. The program made use of the XR Interaction Toolkit and Photon Networking.
<br />
<br />I'm continuing to improve my knowledge in C++, C#, and Python.
